								<h2>About Me</h2>
							</header>

							<a href="#" class="image featured"><img src="images/exploreMountains2.jpg" alt="" /></a>

							<p>I am a social and collaborative engineer who enjoys taking on challenging problems. I have worked on complex and technical software projects from concept to completion. My extroverted personality allows me to work seamlessly with all of the different personalities and roles which must come together to ensure a project achieves meaningful success.</p>

							<p>In my last role, I was redefining real estate at Redfin as a part of two different teams. My first team was Transaction Efficiency where we improved Redfin's real estate brokerage by creating deal management software to help our teams work together to close deals faster. We did this by providing an intuitive and beautiful React UI to assign tasks across an agent team, a document management system to store documents, and useful reminders; all powered by a Java backend.</p>

							<p>Next, I moved on to the Sell-Side Customer Growth team where we strived to increase Redfin's customer conversion rate by informing site visitors what Redfin services were available and which ones would be most valuable for them. In the background, we were moving our team's backend services from the monolith code base into isolated K8s. I loved working at Redfin and developing the internal tools for our agent teams, improving customer inquiry questionnaires, and above all, the culture.</p>

							<p>Before Redfin, I was connecting the world, both physically and culturally, by designing, testing, and certifying airplanes. In my last role at the Boeing Company, I served as the technical lead for the 777X airplane's Folding Wingtip System overseeing a team of 18 engineers. My responsibilities included software control and mechanical actuation; all the way from brainstorming original concepts through ensuring the system was ready for the airplane’s first flight.</p> 

							<p>The process of developing the Folding Wingtip System involved defining system and flight control software requirements, establishing robust sequence diagrams, developing a control system using MathWorks Simulink and Stateflow which autocoded to C, system normal and abnormal simulation, hardware-in-the-loop software testing with an integrated test vehicle, problem report and resolution management, root cause analysis, solution creation, and thorough code reviews.</p>

							<p>Before moving to 777X Product Development, I found the match for my aviation passion by flying on and testing the Queen of the Skies, the 747. As a flight test engineer, I developed a deep understanding of many airplane systems, designed ground and flight test cases, flew onboard to monitor test quality and system performance, and then analyzed post-flight data to document certification compliance in FAA/EASA reports.</p>

							<p>After over 13 years at Boeing, I returned to school via an intensive 6-month coding bootcamp to challenge myself, feed my curiosity, and learn more modern programming languages and frameworks. The instruction at Code Fellow grew my software skills which nicely supplements my mechanical engineering bachelor's degree from Rolla.</p>

							<p>I find creating and producing things both enjoyable and fulfilling, whether the product is software or physical. For my next role, I look forward to being part of a team who is dedicated to achieving a difficult and interesting challenge within a collaborative, communicative, and supportive environment.</p>
